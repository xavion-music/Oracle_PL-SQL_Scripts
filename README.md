Oracle PL/SQL Practice Scripts

This repository is a collection of Oracle PL/SQL scripts I created through self-practice and exploration of relational databases, SQL, and PL/SQL programming.
It serves as a personal knowledge base and demonstrates my learning journey in building, managing, and interacting with databases using Oracle SQL Developer.

Key Areas Covered

Database Schema and Table Creation
Scripts for designing and creating relational tables with constraints.

Stored Procedures and Functions
Implementations for modular programming and reusable database logic.

Exception Handling
Examples of system-defined and user-defined exceptions for reliable error handling.

Transactions and Permissions
Practical use of COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, and GRANT/REVOKE statements.

Control Structures and CASE
Demonstrations of conditional logic and looping within PL/SQL blocks.

Analytical and Hierarchical Queries
Advanced SQL features including hierarchical queries and analytical functions.

Practice Databases
Sample datasets such as student records and book reviews for hands-on experiments.
